<h2>STEVEN SPIELBERG</h2>
<p>Was born and in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 18, 1946. From a young age he has been interested in film, when Spielberg was 12 he filmed a movie from script using a cast of actors. When he was 16, he filmed a feature-length science fiction movie called Firelight, and his father rented out a movie theater for it's premiere. The film cost $500 and in that one night he made it back. </p>
<p>
Throughtout his early life his family traveled for work which landed them in "Silicon Valley" near San Jose, California. Spielberg's grades weren't the best in high school so when he applied to the University of Southern California (UCLA) he was denied, but he was accepted at the California State College at Long Island Beach. There he studied video production, but left after 3 years due to an offer at Universal Studios for his first big break. From there, he went on to produce block buster films.</p>
		<p>
Spielbergâ€™s love for film didn't get in the way of his education. When he was in his early 50's he went back to the California State College at Long Island Beach and finished his B.F.A. in Video production. He made a promise to his parents when he first left college for Uinversal Studios that'd he finish and preached to his kids the importance of college.&nbsp; </p>
